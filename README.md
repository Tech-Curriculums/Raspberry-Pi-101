Mathematica
-----------

Raspberry Pi now comes with a free version of Mathematica, which is the swiss-army knife tool of many scientists (especially Physicists and Mathematicians!). 

Here we'll learn how to have Mathematica solve algebraic equations, and do much magic.


Hello Raspberry Pi
------------------

we begin with the command line.  
We'll start by learning how to use the shell, and how to use ssh to get a shell on another Pi.

We'll play Capture the file and create speech output on the Rasbperry Pi.

Raspberry Pi GPIO
-----------------

in this unit we'll learn how to control the Raspberry Pi Gpio, making a basic python program to make a motion detector robot.
